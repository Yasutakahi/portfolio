        Including the skills shown above, I have used JavaScript and R to complete
        a project at the University of Toronto. I am able to create a report using 
        R markdown which has visualization of the data or table of a sample. For JavaScript, 
        I used it for the animation on the website I created. Moreover, I have completed
        a coursera course called Google Analytics Professional Certificate. In this couse,
        I demonstrated hands-on experience with data cleaning (SQL and Google Sheets),

        Worked as software engineer at the company called Techouse. The programming
         language used to complete projects is Ruby and Ruby on rails. I developed 
         a website using ruby on rails and also had group project completing one of 
         the processes of the actual product that the company is providing to customers.
         For example ---

        The comapny I had an internship at is called Techouse. This company does
        mainly two thiings. First they provides a platform that connects 
        people who are looking for a job to a companies that are looking for 
        workers. They connects people with companies by using various techniques
        such as AI. Secondly, the compnay also provides human resources platform
        called Cloud house which collects and use human resources effectively 
        through techonologies. Unlike the most of the companies, Techouse asks
        for customers' feedback for the platform so we can adjust to each 
        customer's need. More information about Techouse can be found
